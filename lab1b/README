Project 1a

This implementation opens file, runs command in parallel, and can verbose options as required.  

Besides, user input is strictly check before utilization. For example, 
1. If parameters of an option is too many or too few, warning/error will be printed to screen. 
2. If a file fails to open, an error will be printed to screen. 
3. If an parameters of an option is invalid, say, exceeded file descriptor or non-number string as file descriptor, error message will be printed to screen. 
4. If the executable fails to execute, error will be printed to screen. 

I used malloc/realloc to dynamically assign space in the program. 


Project 1b

This implementation adds --wait option and signal handling functionality to simpsh, as specified on course web.
